          <h3>A Small Glimpse into the World of Carla Kroll</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Illinois, I am an avid Chicago sports fan. Chicago Cubs, Bears, Bull, and Blackhawks - in that order. Watching the Cubs finally win a World Series was an amazing moment that I'll never forget.</p>
          <p>I spent 6 years in the USAF as an Aerospace Ground Equipment mechanic. The military really helped develop me into the person I am today. The military gave me discipline, a desire to grow, and the perseverence to not give up. </p>
          <p>When I first separated from the military, I began going to school and did get my Associates degree for desktop publishing. After a few years of working, it was made clear to me that if I wanted to grow in this field, I needed to develop skills for coding. I have been working with HTML and CSS for quite a while now. I have also learned how to use and modify some CMS applications, such as WordPress and Joomla. Although I do not yet have the skills to build the templates from scratch, I have often been tasked with customizing or modifying existing templates.</p>

          <p>I really enjoy working with code and I love that it is always growing and expanding. Continuing education is very important to me, and in this field, there is never a lack of information to be absorbed.</p>

          <p>I am an animal lover. I currently have 2 rescue dogs that I love so much!<br />
          Tucker, my very first dog as an adult, is a 3 year old German Shepherd/Cattle Dog mix.</p>
          <div class="right1"><img src="images/lucy1.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>
          <p>Lucy is a 2 year old pocket pit that loves snuggles and giving kisses more than any dog I've ever met.</p>
          <p>Besides writing code for a living, being involved in animal rescue has become a very important part of my life. I try to fundraise for rescues that are important to me, and volunteer at local shelters on occassion.</p>
